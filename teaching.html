               <summary>Class Description</summary>
  <p>Anchored in the principles of innovation and technology strategy, this capstone blends academic rigor with practical application. You will engage with frameworks from technology strategy, innovation management, and entrepreneurial finance, while analyzing recent cases across emerging areas such as space, biotech, AI, and more. The course moves from evaluating ideas and opportunities to de-risking each of the four core areas of risk that tough tech ventures face: technology risk, market risk, regulatory risk, scale risk, and financing risk. You will then synthesize this knowledge into a comprehensive commercialization approach—an “entrepreneurial strategy” for your venture.</p>
