        <h1>Jane Wu</h1>
     
        <p>I am a PhD candidate at  <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/ties/about-us" >MIT Sloan</a> interested in the intersection of innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy. 
          
        <p>My research broadly focuses on the role of metrics in shaping firm innovation. I also study the entrepreneurial strategy choices that high-growth startup founders encounter. </p>
        
        <p>Prior to graduate school, I co-founded an education software startup (out of a leading Canadian <a href ="https://www.nextcanada.com/next-36/">entrepreneurship program</a> and <a href = "https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/">accelerator</a>), worked in venture capital in <a href ="https://relayventures.com/">Toronto</a> and <a href="https://www.foundercollective.com/">Boston</a>, and conducted research at the <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Harvard Business School ISC</a>.</p>
      
        <p>I am currently on the job market, and interested in tenure-track positions in management departments.</p>

        <summary>Abstract</summary>
        Metrics permeate our daily lives, firm R&D, and scientific and technological progress. At the same time, because they are often taken as given, we have limited understanding of their impact on innovation. This paper explores how metrics shape the rate and direction of innovation. By taking advantage of a unique change in the US automobile industry, I estimate how the introduction of a novel metric for automotive safety (SID) influenced safety outcomes and firm performance. Using rich data on US vehicular accidents and car specifications, I find that the new metric significantly reduced fatalities, but did so disproportionately for occupants similar to SID. These two results were driven by different types of firms: while firms with pre-existing strategic investments in safety were able to make improvements that benefited everyone, those without a history in safety ended up narrowly focusing on the metric. Taken together, these findings show that metrics can profoundly affect the innovation trajectories of firms, and that firms without ex-ante domain expertise may suffer from metric myopia. Moreover, the choices firms make in response to a metric can, consciously or not, determine who benefits from innovation.        </details></p>
