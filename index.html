      <h1> Jane Wu </h1>
        <p>I am a PhD candidate at  <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/ties/about-us" >MIT Sloan</a> interested in the intersection of innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy. This summer, I will be joining  <a href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty-and-research/strategy" >UCLA</a> as an Assistant Professor.
          
        <p>My research broadly focuses on the role of metrics in shaping firm innovation. I also study the entrepreneurial strategy choices that high-growth startup founders encounter. </p>
        
        <p>Prior to graduate school, I co-founded an education software startup (out of a leading Canadian <a href ="https://www.nextcanada.com/next-36/">entrepreneurship program</a> and <a href = "https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/">accelerator</a>), worked in venture capital in <a href ="https://relayventures.com/">Toronto</a> and <a href="https://www.foundercollective.com/">Boston</a>, and conducted research at the <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Harvard Business School ISC</a>.</p>

        Metrics permeate our daily lives, yet we know surprisingly little about the crucial role they play in scientific and technological progress. This paper takes a first step at filling this void by exploring how metrics shape the rate and direction of innovation in firms. By taking advantage of a unique change in the US automobile industry, I estimate how the introduction of a novel metric for automotive safety (SID) influenced safety outcomes and firm performance. Using rich data on US vehicular accidents and car specifications, I find that the new metric significantly reduced fatalities, but did so disproportionately for occupants similar to SID. These two results were driven by different types of firms: while firms with pre-existing knowledge and strategic investments in safety were able to make improvements that benefited everyone, those without a history in safety ended up narrowly focusing on the metric. Taken together, these findings show that metrics can profoundly affect the innovation trajectories of firms, and that firms without ex-ante domain expertise may suffer from metric myopia. Moreover, the choices that firms make in response to a metric can, consciously or not, determine who benefits from innovation.
