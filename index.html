        <h1>About</h1>
     
        <p>I am a PhD candidate at  <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/ties/about-us" >MIT Sloan</a> interested in the intersection of innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy. 
          
        <p>My research broadly focuses on the role of metrics in shaping innovation within firms. I also study the entrepreneurial strategy choices that high-growth startup founders encounter. </p>
        
        <p>Prior to graduate school, I co-founded an education software start-up, participated in an accelerator program, and worked in early-stage venture capital in Boston, Menlo Park, Hong Kong and Toronto.</p>
      
        <p>I am currently on the job market, and interested in tenure-track positions in management departments.</p>
