        <h1>Jane Wu</h1>
     
        <p>I am a PhD candidate at  <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/ties/about-us" >MIT Sloan</a> interested in the intersection of innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy. 
          
        <p>My research broadly focuses on the role of metrics in shaping firm innovation. I also study the entrepreneurial strategy choices that high-growth startup founders encounter. </p>
        
        <p>Prior to graduate school, I co-founded an education software startup (out of a leading Canadian <a href ="https://www.nextcanada.com/next-36/">entrepreneurship program</a> and <a href = "https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/">accelerator</a>), worked in venture capital in <a href ="https://relayventures.com/">Toronto</a> and <a href="https://www.foundercollective.com/">Boston</a>, and conducted research at the <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Harvard Business School ISC</a>.</p>
      
        <p>I am currently on the job market, and interested in tenure-track positions in management departments.</p>

          This paper develops an integrated framework linking the nature of the entrepreneurial choice process to the foundations of entrepreneurial strategy. Because entrepreneurs face many alternatives that cannot be pursued at once, entrepreneurs must adopt (implicitly or explicitly) a process for choosing among entrepreneur- ial strategies. The interplay between uncertainty and learn- ing has the consequence that commitment-free analysis yields multiple, equally viable alternatives from which one must be chosen. This endogenous gap between optimization and choice is a central paradox confronting entrepreneurs. Resolving this allows for a reformulation of the foundations of entrepreneurial strategy, emphasizing the role of choice rather than the centrality of the strategic environment.

        Scientific and technological metrics permeate and shape daily life, yet are typically taken as given, leaving the impact they have on innovation unexamined. This paper explores this understudied yet influential role of metrics by estimating the impact of a unique change in the US automobile industry, the introduction of the side impact dummy (SID) as a novel metric for automotive safety. Using rich data on vehicular accidents in the US, combined with hand-collected data on car specifications, I document that SID led to significant reductions in side-impact fatalities, but also to disproportionate improvements for SID-like drivers. This aggregate effect was driven by different innovative responses from firms. While some firms focused on making improvements to side protection that would benefit all occupants regardless of size, other firms, by focusing on the new metric, made costly changes to their vehicles that primarily benefited occupants more precisely covered by SID. Moreover, this variation corresponds to differences in the level of strategic commitments in safety that firms had made prior to the introduction of SID, suggesting that an organizationâ€™s experience with a problem may have 
may have played a role in avoiding "metric myopia." Taken together, the findings suggest that the introduction of a metric to an industry impacts the innovation trajectories of firms differently depending on their degree of ex- ante domain expertise, and that this translates into meaningful differences in terms of who ultimately benefits from innovation.
