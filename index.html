        <h1>Jane Wu</h1>
     
        <p>I am a PhD candidate at  <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/ties/about-us" >MIT Sloan</a> interested in the intersection of innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy. 
          
        <p>My research broadly focuses on the role of metrics in shaping firm innovation. I also study the entrepreneurial strategy choices that high-growth startup founders encounter. </p>
        
        <p>Prior to graduate school, I co-founded an education software startup (out of a leading Canadian <a href ="https://www.nextcanada.com/next-36/">entrepreneurship program</a> and <a href = "https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/">accelerator</a>), worked in venture capital in <a href ="https://relayventures.com/">Toronto</a> and <a href="https://www.foundercollective.com/">Boston</a>, and conducted research at the <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Harvard Business School ISC</a>.</p>
      
        <p>I am currently on the job market, and interested in tenure-track positions in management departments.</p>

          This paper develops an integrated framework linking the nature of the entrepreneurial choice process to the foundations of entrepreneurial strategy. Because entrepreneurs face many alternatives that cannot be pursued at once, entrepreneurs must adopt (implicitly or explicitly) a process for choosing among entrepreneur- ial strategies. The interplay between uncertainty and learn- ing has the consequence that commitment-free analysis yields multiple, equally viable alternatives from which one must be chosen. This endogenous gap between optimization and choice is a central paradox confronting entrepreneurs. Resolving this allows for a reformulation of the foundations of entrepreneurial strategy, emphasizing the role of choice rather than the centrality of the strategic environment.

        <p>"Nothing Happens in a Vacuum: Can a Dominant Metric Be Shifted?"<small> [Under Review]</small> <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
          Metrics and measurement standards, by lowering the costs of collaboration and comparison, play an important role in shaping the pace and direction of innovation. Yet in some cases, the dominant metric an industry orients itself around may lose, over time, some of its original ability to successfully advance a field, or even misdirect attention and effort or introduce negative externalities. This paper studies whether it is possible to move firms away from a metric that has become a key focusing device for all of R&D and competition within their industry, and channel the firms’ investments in R&D towards a new policy direction (more energy efficiency rather than higher powered devices). To address this question, the paper takes advantage of a policy shock to estimate the effects of the ”removal” of a metric (watts) within the European vacuum cleaner industry. While the objective of policymakers was to shift firms away from focusing on watts and improve energy efficiency, results show that there was no discernible change in the latter. Instead, the paper finds a severe crowding out effect, with firms reducing their R&D investment in the focal area affected by the policy (as measured by patents). This relationship is larger in magnitude when accounting for patent quality, suggesting that this reduction is not simply driven by a lower number of fringe patents. Moreover, firms are not simply stopping their R&D investments but rather moving their effort towards adjacent product categories that are still unregulated. Taken together, the paper introduces the idea that removing a dominant metric in a given industry is not sufficient, possibly because of strong path dependency, to induce meaningful investments in a novel, desired direction. Combining the removal of a metric with additional guidance and support targeted at lowering the costs firms face in searching for and adopting an alternative metric is more likely to lead to meaningful, long term changes in the direction of innovation policymakers may be looking for.</details></p>  
        <p>"Innovation for Dummies: Exploring the Role of Metrics in Automotive Safety" <small> [Job Market Paper] </small></p>
        <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
          Scientific and technological metrics permeate and shape daily life, yet are typically taken as given,leaving  the  impact  they  have  on  innovation  unexamined.   This  paper  explores  this  understudied  yetinfluential role of metrics by estimating the impact of a unique change in the US automobile industry,the introduction of the side impact dummy (SID) as a novel metric for automotive safety.  Using rich dataon vehicular accidents in the US, combined with hand-collected data on car specifications, I documentthat SID led to significant reductions in side-impact fatalities, but also to disproportionate improvementsfor SID-like drivers.  This aggregate effect was driven by different innovative responses from firms.  Whilesome firms focused on making improvements to side protection that would benefit all occupants regardlessof size, other firms, by focusing on the new metric, made costly changes to their vehicles that primarilybenefited occupants more precisely covered by SID. Moreover, this variation corresponds to differencesin the level of strategic commitments in safety that firms had made prior to the introduction of SID,suggesting that an organization’s experience with a problem may have may have played a role in avoiding“metric myopia.”  Taken together, the findings suggest that the introduction of a metric to an industryimpacts  the  innovation  trajectories  of  firms  differently  depending  on  their  degree  of  ex-  ante  domainexpertise, and that this translates into meaningful differences in terms of who ultimately benefits frominnovation. </details></p>
